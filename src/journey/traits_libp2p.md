# Exploring libp2p Traits: Understanding the Magic Behind `with_tcp`

I recently started learning about libp2p and got into it with a simple ping example. However, something in the code caught my eye - the use of `with_tcp` with a function pointer. I was curious about why it accepts a constructor like `noise::Config::new` and how it all works.

```rust
let mut swarm = libp2p::SwarmBuilder::with_new_identity()
    .with_tokio()
    .with_tcp(
        tcp::Config::default(),
        noise::Config::new,
        yamux::Config::default,
    )?
    .with_behaviour(|_| ping::Behaviour::default())?
    .with_swarm_config(|cfg| cfg.with_idle_connection_timeout(Duration::from_secs(u64::MAX)))
    .build();
```

## The Mystery of `with_tcp`

Initially, the function pointer in `with_tcp` puzzled me. Upon digging in, I found out it's a procedural macro creating both `with_tcp` for Tokio and async-std. But why pass a constructor function like `noise::Config::new`? And how is it actually used?

## Unraveling the Traits

I discovered that the function parameter in `with_tcp` needs a trait called `IntoSecurityUpgrade<C>`. Wanting to understand this, I checked out the trait. My goal was to grasp why `new` is possible.

```rust
pub trait IntoSecurityUpgrade<C> {
    type Upgrade;
    type Error;

    fn into_security_upgrade(self, keypair: &str) -> Result<Self::Upgrade, Self::Error>;
}

// Implementation for a function with the signature FnOnce(&'a str) -> Result<T, E>
impl<C, T, F, E> IntoSecurityUpgrade<C> for F
where
    F: for<'a> FnOnce(&'a str) -> Result<T, E>,
{
    // Associated types for the trait
    type Upgrade = T;
    type Error = E;

    // Implementation using the provided function
    fn into_security_upgrade(self, keypair: &str) -> Result<Self::Upgrade, Self::Error> {
        (self)(keypair)
    }
}
```

## The Macro's Revelation

Digging into the `with_tcp` macro, I found a crucial trait bound that makes the code generic for specific async implementations.

```rust
// $path is the third parameter in the macro
SecUpgrade: IntoSecurityUpgrade<libp2p_tcp::$path::TcpStream>

// Relevant code snippet within the macro
Ok(SwarmBuilder {
    transport: libp2p_tcp::$path::Transport::new(tcp_config)
        .upgrade(libp2p_core::upgrade::Version::V1Lazy)
        .authenticate(
            security_upgrade.into_security_upgrade(&self.keypair)?,
        )
        .multiplex(multiplexer_upgrade.into_multiplexer_upgrade())
        .map(|(p, c), _| (p, StreamMuxerBox::new(c))),
    // Additional configuration details...
})
```

## Making Sense of `IntoSecurityUpgrade`

Looking back at `IntoSecurityUpgrade`, the trait takes a function pointer, matching the constructor signature. The seemingly complex `F: for<'a> FnOnce(&'a str) -> Result<T, E>` actually matches the constructor's signature.

```rust
impl<C, T, F, E> IntoSecurityUpgrade<C> for F
where
    F: for<'a> FnOnce(&'a str) -> Result<T, E>,
{
    type Upgrade = T;
    type Error = E;

    fn into_security_upgrade(self, keypair: &str) -> Result<Self::Upgrade, Self::Error> {
        (self)(keypair) // Resembles calling the constructor function (e.g., noise::Config::new(keypair))
    }
}
```

Though I might not fully grasp the entire process, this journey helped me understand rust better. I now get how the `new` function works.

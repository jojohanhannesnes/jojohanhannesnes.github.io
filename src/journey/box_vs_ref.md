# Understanding Box and References in Rust

Consider this example where the size of a value is not known at compile time, leading to a common compiler error:

```rust
let a: FooString = FooString {
    x: String::from("hello"),
};
let length = a.x.len();
println!("{:?}", a.x[0..length / 2]); // Need to use a reference
```

In this case, using a reference would result in a compiler error. However, using `Box` or a reference (`&`) allows you to circumvent this issue, as both provide a reference to the value whose size is known at compile time.

But here's the twist: while `Box` and references seem similar in that they both reference a value, they behave differently when it comes to unknown sizes. Consider this example:

```rust
let data = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let slice_ref = &data[0..3];
println!("{:?}", slice_ref);

// This line causes a compile-time error because Box cannot determine the size of the slice at compile time
// let boxed_slice = Box::new(data[0..3]);
```

In this case, `slice_ref` works because references (`&`) reserve an address for a value whose size is later calculated. However, `Box` cannot determine the size of the slice at compile time, leading to a compiler error.

Using the same technique, `Box` won't work, why? because `Box` doesn't even know the size on the compile time, with reference, it's reserving the address, to a value that later calculated, `Box` is just a technique to do heap allocations, if the value is not known at compile time, i assume `Box` doesn't even know how much space to calculate, however if we change `Box` value to slice_ref it will work, because `&` is a known size.

> **Note**: Trying to Box the first example will not work as well because of the same reason.

# Why do i want to do this?

In the world of programming, I found myself drawn to Rust, and the question that loomed was, "Why do I want to do this?"

I wasn't setting out to create the next Rust bible or tutorial hub. No, my blog was meant to be my personal space, a sanctuary for my thoughts and experiences on this journey. I wanted to document my progress, learn from my mistakes, and celebrate my growth.

Rust had altered my perspective on programming. Its emphasis on safety and performance had struck a chord with me. My blog, in my eyes, was a canvas where I'd paint my insights, my 'Aha!' moments, and even my 'Ugh, why doesn't this work?' moments.

It wasn't about teaching Rust to the world; it was about sharing my personal journey. If someone found value in my words, great, but my primary goal was to pour out everything I'd learned with Rust.

As I type these words, my blog is my companion on this Rust adventure, a diary of my challenges, my victories, and the passion that Rust has kindled within me. This is why I want to do this, to create my own little corner in the vast programming universe, where my Rust journey unfolds.

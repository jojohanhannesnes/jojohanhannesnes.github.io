# Welcome to my Rust journey! 
This blog is not your typical programming guide or tutorial hub. 

It's a personal space where I'm sharing my experiences, discoveries, and everything I've learned along the way with Rust.

I've organized this exploration into several distinct sections:

- [The Journey](journey/index.html) - Here, you'll find my day-to-day coding adventures and the cool stuff I stumble upon.

- [The Stuff](topics/index.html) - Think of it as my Rubber Duck for diving into specific Rust concepts.

- [The Projects](project.md) - Of course, this is where I showcase my projects.

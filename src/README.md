# Welcome to my Rust journey! 
This blog is not your typical programming guide or tutorial hub. 

It's a personal space where I'm sharing my experiences, discoveries, and everything I've learned along the way with Rust.

I've organized this exploration into several distinct sections:

- [The Journey](journey/index.html)

- [The Projects](project.md)

- [The Algorithms](algorithm.md)

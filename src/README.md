# Welcome to my Rust journey!
It's a personal space where I'm sharing my experiences, discoveries, and everything I've learned along the way with Rust.<br><br>
Rust had altered my perspective on programming. My blog, in my eyes,it's just my 'Aha!' moments, and even my 'Ugh, why doesn't this work?' moments.

I've organized this exploration into several distinct sections:

- [Journey](journey/index.html) - Here, you'll find my day to day coding adventures and the cool stuff I stumble upon.

- [Projects](project.md) - Learning Rust through creating projects.
